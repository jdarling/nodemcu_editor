Simple Stupid Web based IDE for the NodeMCU
---

Yep, its in Node.js and seems to work, most of the time.  Still needs a lot of
work done to be called complete, but the basics are in place.

For some dumb reason you have to send a line of text, wait for the prompt and
then you can send another request.  For this reason it takes FOREVER to upload
large files.

Pull requests with new features/functions welcome.
